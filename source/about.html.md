Lisa Eisner was raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming, moved to New York City in 1979 to work for Conde Nast magazines, Mademoiselle and Vogue. In the mid-80’s she married and relocated to Los Angeles where she stepped into the role of west-coast fashion editor of Vogue. (Her two grown sons have flown the coop.)

After more than 15 years in the fashion business, she decided to focus on her own photography and interest in subcultures and ceremonies. She has published two books of her work, Rodeo Girl (1999) and Shriners (2004). In 1999, she co-founded _Greybull Press_ in order to publish art and photography books by artists including R Crumb, Richard Prince, and Dennis Hopper. Eisner has contributed to W, Vogue Paris, Pop, The New York Times Magazine, T Magazine, Vanity Fair, Travel + Leisure, Departures, Harpers Bazaar and Liberation. Solo shows of her photographs have been exhibited at Jan Kesner (Rodeo Girl, 2000) and M+B Gallery (A Butterfly Fluttered By, 2006 and Psychonaut, 2010).

In 2014, Eisner launched her own hand crafted line of jewelry. In 2015, she collaborated with Tom Ford with the creation of [‘LE for TF’](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-ford-fetes-lisa-eisners-744923), a line of fine jewelry for his 2015 collections. With the success of this venture, her personal line expanded into some of the world’s top luxury retailers: Maxfield (LA), Net-a-Porter, Karry Berreby (Paris), and Forty Five Ten (Dallas). An installation of her jewelry was held in the exclusive [Jean Prouvé Nomade Structure](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-ford-fetes-lisa-eisners-744923) at fashion retailer Maxfield (Nomad 1957, 2015), with her first NY exhibit opening November 2016 at Salon 94. 

> “ I am—and will always be—inspired by California in the 70’s. Especially Big Sur. I had this vision of driving down Highway 1 and finding this beach shack with a sign that says “Handmade Jewelry” and inside the shack is some dude with long hair at his bench making all this amazing organic, hand forged jewelry that you always dreamed of finding but never could. Like I said, it’s a vision. It’s not real. So I’ve been trying ever since to make it as real as it can be.

> This collection is inspired by the two sides of Big Sur. One side is embellished and encrusted and comes from the turbulent tide pools and kelp beds that are filled with invertebrates, protozoa, decapods, urchins, barnacles and sea anemones. And the other side is pure and clean like the serene California coastline.

> Everything is made in bronze with a special patina that looks like a beautiful worn gold. I hand pick the stones for each piece—American turquoise from a family-owned mine in Arizona, Big Sur and Wyoming jade, and fossilized stones from a variety of wonderful weird rock hounds. To me, each piece is its own magic-infused little sculpture that carries some of the mystical feelings I have about Big Sur. “ —Lisa Eisner
