### Story

I am&mdash;and will always be&mdash;inspired by California in the 70&rsquo;s. Especially Big Sur. I had this vision of driving down Highway 1 and finding this beach shack with a sign that says &ldquo;Handmade Jewelry&rdquo; and inside the shack is some dude with long hair at his bench making all this amazing organic, hand forged jewelry that you always dreamed of finding but never could. Like I said, it's a vision. It's not real. So I've been trying ever since to make it as real as it can be.

This collection is inspired by the two sides of Big Sur. One side is embellished and encrusted and comes from the turbulent tide pools and kelp beds that are filled with  invertebrates, protozoa, decapods, urchins, barnacles and sea anemones. And the other side is pure and clean like the serene California coastline.

Everything is made in bronze with a special patina that looks like a beautiful worn gold. I hand pick the stones for each piece&mdash;American turquoise from a family-owned mine in Arizona, Big Sur jade and fossilized stones from a variety of wonderful weird rock hounds.

To me, each piece is its own magic-infused little sculpture that carries some of the mystical feelings I have about Big Sur.
