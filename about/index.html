<p><br />
<strong>Lisa Eisner</strong> was raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming, moved to New York City in 1979
to work for Conde Nast magazines, <em>Mademoiselle</em> and <em>Vogue</em>. In the mid-80’s
she married and relocated to Los Angeles where she stepped into the role of
west-coast fashion editor of <em>Vogue</em>. (Her two grown sons have flown the coop.)</p>

<p>After more than 15 years in the fashion business, she decided to focus on her
own photography and interest in subcultures and ceremonies. She has published
two books of her work, <em>Rodeo Girl</em> (1999) and <em>Shriners</em> (2004). In 1999, she
co-founded <strong>Greybull Press</strong> in order to publish art and photography books by
artists including R Crumb, Richard Prince, and Dennis Hopper. Eisner has
contributed to <em>W</em>, <em>Vogue Paris</em>, <em>Pop</em>, <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>T
Magazine</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>Travel + Leisure</em>, <em>Departures</em>, <em>Harpers Bazaar</em> and
<em>Liberation</em>. Solo shows of her photographs have been exhibited at Jan Kesner
(<em>Rodeo Girl</em>, 2000) and M+B Gallery (<em>A Butterfly Fluttered By</em>, 2006 and
<em>Psychonaut</em>, 2010).</p>

<p>In 2014, Eisner launched her own hand crafted line of jewelry. In 2015, she
collaborated with Tom Ford with the creation of ‘LE for TF’, a line of fine
jewelry for his 2015 collections. With the success of this venture, her personal
line expanded into some of the world’s top luxury retailers: Maxfield (LA),
Net-a-Porter, Karry Berreby (Paris), and Forty Five Ten (Dallas). An
installation of her jewelry was held in the exclusive Jean Prouvé Nomade
Structure at fashion retailer Maxfield (Nomad 1957, 2015), with her first NY
exhibit held at Salon 94 in 2016. In Summer 2017, Bergdorf Goodman began
carrying the jewelry line within their unique floor curated by Linda Fargo,
showcasing Farrow's most coveted pieces of fashion</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I am—and will always be—inspired by California in the 70’s. Especially Big
Sur. I had this vision of driving down Highway 1 and finding this beach shack
with a sign that says “Handmade Jewelry” and inside the shack is some dude
with long hair at his bench making all this amazing organic, hand forged
jewelry that you always dreamed of finding but never could. Like I said, it’s
a vision. It’s not real. So I’ve been trying ever since to make it as real as
it can be.</p>

  <p>This collection is inspired by the two sides of Big Sur. One side is
embellished and encrusted and comes from the turbulent tide pools and kelp
beds that are filled with invertebrates, protozoa, decapods, urchins,
barnacles and sea anemones. And the other side is pure and clean like the
serene California coastline.</p>

  <p>Everything is made in bronze with a special patina that looks like a beautiful
worn gold. I hand pick the stones for each piece—American turquoise from a
family-owned mine in Arizona, Big Sur and Wyoming jade, and fossilized stones
from a variety of wonderful weird rock hounds. To me, each piece is its own
magic-infused little sculpture that carries some of the mystical feelings I
have about Big Sur.“</p>
</blockquote>
